# Prediction-using-supervised-ML

This project utilizes supervised machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. The dataset used for this project contains information about students' study hours and their corresponding scores.

**Dataset**:

The dataset used for this project consists of two columns: Study Hours and Scores. Each row represents a student's study hours and their corresponding score in percentage.

**Methodology:**

Linear regression is employed to establish a relationship between the study hours and scores. The linear regression model is trained on the dataset to learn this relationship, enabling us to predict the score of a student based on their study hours.

**Prediction:**

Given a study duration of 9.25 hours per day, the model predicts the percentage score the student is likely to achieve.

**Results:**

The predicted score for a student studying 9.25 hours per day is 92.14523314523314

**Usage:**

To utilize this prediction model:

1.Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2.Clone this repository.

3.Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

4.Run the prediction script.
